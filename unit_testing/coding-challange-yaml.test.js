The purpose of this file is to do unit testing of all the files in the
_CodingChallenges directory, in order to insure they are all valid.

If you are trying to read the source of the website and are unsure as to what
this file does/what unit testing is, I reccomend you check out the coding train's
video on it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3QwafQEvSs, it's where I learn't
everything needed to create this script.

const yaml = require('js-yaml'); // js-yaml helps us read yaml of files
const fs = require('fs'); // fs is file system package

checkHasUndefinedRecursive() checks if an object has undefined or null
properties, and if it doesn't but it has properties which are objects,
recursivly check the properties to see if the have an undefined property.

Is used to check if YAML has undeined feilds.

        /************ IMPORTANT NOTE **********************
          The Community Contributions Guide
          (https://github.com/CodingTrain/website/wiki/Community-Contributions-Guide)
          specifies that a user should include the following feilds in their
          contribution: title, author.name and url. However when I tested that
          this was the case I found contributer "bobvoorneveld" had chosen not
          to include a url, but had chosen to include a link to his source code.
          This seems reasonable as his projects were made with xcode and so it
          would be hard to share an excecutable, and his decision didn't seem to
          break anything. In order to allow his and others decisions to omit the
          url but include source, I changed the test to allow for it. Maybe it
          should throw an error if a "strict" variable is set to true.
