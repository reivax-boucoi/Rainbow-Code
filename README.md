# Add your own variation

If you want to share your own variation based on a Coding Train video, you can also do this by visiting the page corresponding to the video on our [website](http://thecodingtrain.com). Check out the [Community Contributions Guide](https://github.com/CodingTrain/website/wiki/Community-Contributions-Guide) to see how it's done. It will then be featured right under the video on the website for everyone to see!

# Help adding new videos

We are currently in the process of migrating videos and community contributions to the new system. If you want to help with this, have a look at the [Content Contribution Guide](https://github.com/CodingTrain/website/wiki/Content-Contribution-Guide). Thanks for helping us out!
